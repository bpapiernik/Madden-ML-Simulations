# Madden-ML-Simulations

During the coronavirus pandemic, I collaborated with friends on a data analytics project centered around Madden 20 computer vs. computer simulations streamed on Twitch. We sought to predict the outcomes of these games by analyzing player ratings and comparing overall ratings for different positions across both teams. We developed a Python-based code that linked these ratings to a large sample of head-to-head matchups, enabling us to determine the most critical positions for team success in non-user-controlled games. By running machine learning algorithms on the data, our model generated probabilities for each teamâ€™s likelihood of winning in simulated Madden football games. The model continually updated its predictions and positional importance as new game data was fed into our Excel database, providing insights into player commoditization and identifying undervalued positions based on market dynamics.
